# What is PyTOUGH?

PyTOUGH (Python TOUGH) is a Python library for simplifying, extending and automating the use of the [TOUGH2](http://esd.lbl.gov/research/projects/tough/) geothermal reservoir simulator. Using PyTOUGH, it is possible to automate the creation and editing of TOUGH2 model grids and data files, and the analysis and display of model simulation results, using Python scripts.

# Installing PyTOUGH:

First, make sure you have [Python](http://www.python.org) and the [Numerical Python](http://numpy.scipy.org/) library installed on your machine.  (For some features you will need other libraries such as [Scientific Python](http://www.scipy.org/) or [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)- consult the user guide for details.)

Copy the PyTOUGH directory onto your machine, by clicking the [Downloads](https://github.com/acroucher/PyTOUGH/downloads) link on the PyTOUGH web page, downloading it as a .zip or .tar.gz file and unzipping it (or by cloning your own local PyTOUGH Git repository).

Finally, add your PyTOUGH directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable on your machine.
