# What is PyTOUGH?

PyTOUGH (Python TOUGH) is a Python library for simplifying, extending and automating the use of the [TOUGH2](http://esd.lbl.gov/research/projects/tough/) subsurface fluid and heat flow simulator. Using PyTOUGH, it is possible to automate the creation and editing of TOUGH2 model grids and data files, and the analysis and display of model simulation results, using Python scripts.

# Installing PyTOUGH:

First, make sure you have [Python](http://www.python.org) and the [Numerical Python](http://numpy.scipy.org/) library installed on your machine.  (For some features you will need other libraries such as [Scientific Python](http://www.scipy.org/) or [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)- consult the user guide for details.)

Click the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/acroucher/PyTOUGH/archive/master.zip) button at the right of the PyTOUGH web page, and save the .zip file to your computer.  Unzip this to any directory on your computer.  This will create a directory containing a file called `setup.py`.  At the command line type `python setup.py install`.

# More information:

For more detailed information on PyTOUGH, consult the user guide (PDF format, in the 'doc' directory of your PyTOUGH install) and the PyTOUGH [wiki](https://github.com/acroucher/PyTOUGH/wiki/), which has links to published articles on PyTOUGH.

# What's new in PyTOUGH?

The latest stable version is 1.3.8, which has:

* Ability to plot block-averaged flow vectors on layer and slice plots

* Support for TOUGHREACT SAVE/INCON files

* Ability to specify characters to use for node and column names when creating mulgrid objects (allows creation of larger grids)

* More accurate calculation of flux matrices (used for generating block-averaged flow vectors for visualization) 

as well as various bug fixes and other minor enhancements.

# Where's the user guide?

Since PyTOUGH version 1.3.6, the PyTOUGH user guide (PyTOUGH-guide.pdf) is now included in the 'doc' directory of your PyTOUGH install.  Previously this was available separately from the 'Downloads' section on the website, but GitHub decided to phase out this 'Downloads' section.
