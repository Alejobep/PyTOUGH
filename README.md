# What is PyTOUGH?

PyTOUGH (Python TOUGH) is a Python library for simplifying, extending and automating the use of the [TOUGH2](http://esd.lbl.gov/research/projects/tough/) geothermal reservoir simulator. Using PyTOUGH, it is possible to automate the creation and editing of TOUGH2 model grids and data files, and the analysis and display of model simulation results, using Python scripts.

# Installing PyTOUGH:

First, make sure you have [Python](http://www.python.org) and the [Numerical Python](http://numpy.scipy.org/) library installed on your machine.  (For some features you will need other libraries such as [Scientific Python](http://www.scipy.org/) or [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)- consult the user guide for details.)

From the [Downloads](https://github.com/acroucher/PyTOUGH/downloads) link on the PyTOUGH web page, under the 'Download packages' section, download PyTOUGH as a .zip file (or .tar.gz if you prefer).  Unzip this to any directory on your computer.  This will create a directory containing a file called 'setup.py'.  At the command line type 'python setup.py install'.
